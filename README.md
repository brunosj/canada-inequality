## Abstract

This paper explores the determinants of political participation in Canada by investigating the relation between income inequality and voter turnout at the Federal Electoral District level. Using recently-published data from the Canadian government, its results provide robust evidence for the existence of a substantial negative relationship between both variables, and show that districts with higher levels of inequality have lower turnout rates. Linear regression models also reveal that voter turnout is positively influenced by the proportion of the total income of a district coming from pension funds and, to a lesser extent, investment revenues. The proportion of income earned by women also matter and is associated with a positive effect on turnout rates, a finding which reflects recent evidence showing that women active in the labour market have higher turnout rates than men during Canadian elections.
